                <p>As a mum and primary teacher I love making learning fun.</p>

                <p>I have designed all our Arty Monkeys classes to appeal to young children's
                    interests whilst allowing them to learn other important life skills for their age.</p>

                <p>
                    For me arts and crafts play a huge part of my family life - both my
                    children love painting, drawing and making things together. A cereal box is never "rubbish" in
                    our
                    house. It's been a television, a spaceship and even part of a bike!</p>

                <p>Children have the most amazing imaginations because they see the world through new
                    eyes. I set up Arty Monkeys to allow these imaginations to flourish and be celebrated. Having
                    taken
                    my own children to various classes over the years I am keen that our classes will be fun for the
                    adults too!</p>

                <p>Ever since I was young I have had an interest and appreciation of things
                    which
                    were made instead of reproduced or bought off the shelf.</p>

                <p>Over the years, especially since having kids, I have </p>

                <p>learned that as well as it
                    being rewarding to create something from scratch, it's actually really really fun! It's also
                    a great way of communicating with my kids. There is nothing better than to see the pure
                    excitement in their eyes while they engineer their ideas. The twinkle when you tell them
                    just how good it looks - priceless!</p>

                <p>With a background running a successful business and a bachelors degree in
                    English Language and Linguistics, I knew I had to do something with this burning desire to
                    bring the same joy and inspiration into other families through arts and crafts.</p>
